##Programming Background

  - Prior to joining Oregon State University, as a student, I had no programming experience.
    I was a fish out of water my first quarter, but CS 161 as a whole was a fun and eye opening class. 

  - Now that I am in my third quarter I have taken a couple of the required courses and would have to say that the class I enjoyed the most is a tie between CS 162 and CS 261. This is because of all the coding projects while my least favorite class was CS 225 just because we did no programming.

  - In the last 6 months I have learned how to code, at a beginner level, in C/C++/Python and I'm excited to learn HTML/Javascript/CSS.
