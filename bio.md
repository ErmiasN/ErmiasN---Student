##Interest and Hobbies 

  - I am a big basketball fan. GO Warriors! 

  - Soccer/Futbol whatever you call it has really grown on me this last year. 

  - Music is in my blood and GENRE doesn't matter. Good Music is Good Music. 

  - Reading, especially anything fiction related: Midnight's Children, Siddartha, Harry Potter Series, etc. 

  - In the last Six months I have grown a deep interest in Coding, thanks in part to Oregon State University. 

  - At any chance I get you can find me at local gym shooting hoops. Its probably my most time consuming hobby.
