##Interest and Hobbies 

  - I am a big basketball fan. GO Warriors! 

  - Soccer/Futbol whatever you call it has really grown on me this last year. 

  - Music is in my blood and GENRE doesn't matter. Good Music is Good Music. 

  - Reading, especially anything fiction related: Midnight's Children, Siddartha, Harry Potter Series, etc. 

  - In the last Six months I have grown a deep interest in Coding, thanks in part to Oregon State University. 

  - At any chance I get you can find me at local gym shooting hoops. Its probably my most time consuming hobby.


##Programming Background

  - Prior to joining Oregon State University, as a student, I had no programming experience.
    I was a fish out of water my first quarter, but CS 161 as a whole was a fun and eye opening class. 

  - Now that I am in my third quarter I have taken a couple of the required courses and would have to say that the class I enjoyed the most is a tie between CS 162 and CS 261. This is because of all the coding projects while my least favorite class was CS 225 just because we did no programming.

  - In the last 6 months I have learned how to code, at a beginner level, in C/C++/Python and I'm excited to learn HTML/Javascript/CSS.
