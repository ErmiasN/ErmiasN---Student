##Interest and Hobbies 

  # I am a big basketball fan. GO Warriors!
  # Soccer/Futbol whatever you call it has really grown on me this last year.

##Programming Background
  - Prior to joining Oregon State University, as a student, I had no programming experience.
    I was a fish out of water my first quarter, but CS 161 as a whole was a fun and eye opening class.
